## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 📦 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`

### 🛠️ Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `/server` folder:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/recapcha
PORT=5050
```

### 📱 Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npx expo start
```

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

- Upon login, the user receives a simple token (user ID)
- This token is stored in `localStorage` on the device
- It is sent in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all secured requests

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Auth

```http
POST   /api/auth/register     # Register new user
POST   /api/auth/login        # Login and get token
GET    /api/auth/user/me      # Get current logged-in user (via token)
```

### Notes

```http
POST   /api/notes             # Create new note (requires token)
```

### Quizzes

```http
POST   /api/quizzes           # Create new quiz associated with a note (requires token)
```

---

## 📦 Data Structure

### 📄 Note

```ts
{
  uuid: string;
  txt: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### ❓ Quiz

```ts
{
  q: string;
  a: {
    a1: boolean;
    a2: boolean;
    a3: boolean;
    a4: boolean;
  };
  note: string;       // references note UUID
  user: string;       // user UUID
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User creates a note** → Stored in backend and linked to user
2. **User generates a quiz** → Tied to the specific note
3. Both are stored and retrievable per user
4. Downloads available as `.txt` and `.json`

---

## 📌 Notes

- Notes and quizzes are embedded arrays in the User schema
- Quizzes reference notes via UUID (fastest for embedded schema)
- Authentication is simplified with user ID tokens
